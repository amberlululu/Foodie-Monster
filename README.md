# Overview:
 Foodie Monster is a website that provides recipes and information for food lovers. After logging in, users will see their personal information on their individual user page. A registered user can create food related articles and others can leave reviews. As a user hits the food recipe link on the nav bar, they are led to the food search page, where they can search the recipes by food name and add food recipes to their favorite lists. Users can also delete recipes from their lists if needed. Additionally, Foodie Monster also provides an open chat room for all users who want to chat and socialize.

I made Foodie Monster because I am a food lover. I want to provide a platform for users to share their thoughts about food and search for food information. My ultimate goal is to provide an ecosystem one stop website to socialize for all lovers of food. To further extend this project, I want to implement the feature to allow users to search nearby restaurants and consider more social functionality like the ability to “follow” other users’ cookbooks.
